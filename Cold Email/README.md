# Cold Email A/B Testing for Internship Applications

## Context

In my internship search, I wanted to experiment with the factors that might influence cold email response rates. Specifically, I tested the impact of email domains (college-affiliated, personal, and general-use) and the inclusion of "US Citizen" in the subject line on recruiter engagement. This experiment was designed to provide insights into how these elements affect response rates and response time.

## Objective

The aim was to determine which combination of **email domain** and **subject line** results in the highest likelihood of getting a reply from recruiters. I hypothesized that a college-affiliated domain and a well-defined subject line might improve engagement.

## Experiment Design

### Variables Tested
1. **Email Domain**:  
   Three different email domains were used to test their influence on recruiter behavior:
   - `.edu` (college-affiliated domain)
   - `@gmail.com` (personal email)
   - `@outlook.com` (general-use email)

2. **Subject Line**:  
   Two variations of the subject line were tested:
   - **With "US Citizen"**: To assess whether explicitly mentioning citizenship status increases the likelihood of a reply.
   - **Without "US Citizen"**: To serve as the baseline and compare the impact of including this detail.

### Setup
- **Email Content**: The body of the email and the sending times were kept consistent across all groups to ensure that only the domain and subject line variations affected the response rate.
- **Sample Size**: A total of **35–50 cold emails** were sent for each domain group, with each subject line variation tested in parallel.
- **Metrics**:  
   - **Reply Rate**: The percentage of responses received.
   - **Time-to-Response**: The average number of hours it took for recruiters to reply.

## Results

The table below summarizes the outcome of the A/B test:

| Email Domain   | Subject Line: "US Citizen" | Reply Rate (%) | Avg. Time-to-Response (Hours) |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| .edu           | Yes                        | 26%            | 15 hours                      |
| .edu           | No                         | 24%            | 17 hours                      |
| @gmail.com     | Yes                        | 16%            | 22 hours                      |
| @gmail.com     | No                         | 14%            | 24 hours                      |
| @outlook.com   | Yes                        | 13%            | 25 hours                      |
| @outlook.com   | No                         | 11%            | 27 hours                      |

## Insights

1. **Impact of Domain**:  
   - **.edu** domains consistently outperformed the others, yielding the highest reply rates and the quickest responses. This suggests that recruiters might perceive emails from academic institutions as more credible or relevant.
   - **@gmail.com** domains also performed reasonably well, particularly when paired with the “US Citizen” subject line. However, the response rate was still lower than `.edu`.
   - **@outlook.com** showed the lowest reply rates, indicating that this domain may be less recognizable or perceived as less professional in the context of cold emailing for internships.

2. **Impact of Subject Line**:  
   - The inclusion of "US Citizen" in the subject line led to a **modest increase** in the reply rate across all domains. However, the most significant improvement was observed with `.edu` emails.
   - Adding “US Citizen” also resulted in a slight reduction in **time-to-response**, suggesting that recruiters might prioritize applicants who clearly align with specific criteria such as citizenship status.

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrated that both **email domain** and **subject line** can significantly influence cold email outcomes. A college-affiliated domain, particularly `.edu`, was the most successful in terms of both reply rate and response time. Including “US Citizen” in the subject line also improved engagement, but this effect was more pronounced when paired with the `.edu` domain.

These findings underscore the importance of **strategically tailoring** email outreach to improve the likelihood of receiving a response. Additionally, the experiment provided insights into the behaviors of recruiters and their potential preferences regarding email domains and subject lines.

## Skills and Methodology

This project highlights my ability to conduct **A/B testing** with multiple variables, analyze data from real-world applications, and optimize cold email outreach strategies. It also demonstrates my understanding of **user behavior analysis**, where the goal is not only to apply but to also **measure and refine** methods for better outcomes.

By performing this experiment, I refined my internship application strategy and gained valuable insights into **cold email effectiveness** and **recruiter preferences**. This research will continue to inform my approach as I apply for future opportunities.
