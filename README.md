## **Technical Writing: Machine Learning and Research**

### [Fuel Cost & Efficiency: A Statistical & Machine Learning Approach to Driver's Decision-Making | Driver's Choice:  Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.compareHighlanders.dataAnalysis.pdf)
**Can a Hybrid Save $500,000 on Fuel in Four Years?**  

Two Uber drivers, Ahmed and Hossain, invest in a **2024 Toyota Highlander**—one hybrid, one gas-powered. With a **$5,900 price gap**, this analysis dissects their real-world fuel costs, long-term savings, and whether **hybrid technology truly pays off**. This data-driven comparative analysis of gas expenses and efficiency between Non-Hybrid and Hybrid Toyota Highlanders leverages predictive analytics to estimate potential savings. Our model forecasts up to $15,000 in gas cost reductions per driver over a 20-month period post-purchase, leading to an aggregated projected savings of $500,000 across the driver cohort.
