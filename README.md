## **Product Design or UI/UX Design Case Study**

### [UI/UX Design Case Study – Personal Website](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/UI-UX-Case-Studies/blob/main/Personal-Website/iMohammed%20©%20-%20UI-UX%20Design%20Case%20Study-2.pdf)  
**How a UI/UX Redesign Boosted Interview Callbacks by 175%**  

*iMohammed* challenges the limitations of generic website templates, delivering a **high-performance, immersive experience** in just **25 hours**. Developed with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project prioritizes **speed, usability, and adaptability**—a seamless fusion of function and design.

### [Uber's Update: UX Research Case Study](#)  
After suggesting a feature to Uber, I noticed it was implemented just a couple of months later. While I can't confirm how directly my feedback contributed, the timing — and the fact that it matched my suggestion exactly — makes me believe it had an impact.

## **Technical Writing: Machine Learning and Research**

### [Fuel Cost & Efficiency: A Statistical & Machine Learning Approach to Driver's Decision-Making | Driver's Choice:  Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Data-AI/tree/main/Driver's%20Choice)

**Can a Hybrids/EVs Save $1,100,000+ on Fuel in Four Years?**  

An AI-driven, end-to-end data science solution built to transform how NYC taxi drivers select vehicles — maximizing fuel efficiency, boosting profitability, and reducing environmental impact. This project merges rigorous statistical validation with **advanced machine learning** to deliver real-world results. By developing an XGBoost model to forecast long-term fuel **cost savings** across hybrid, non-hybrid, and EV vehicles, and building a **full ML pipeline from data collection to deployment**, the system **achieved over $1.1M in economic value**, including $150K+ in **verified** fuel savings and up to $15K saved per driver over 20 months. With over 30 NYC taxi drivers influenced, the solution empowered more informed decision-making and encouraged sustainable practices. A **dynamic Streamlit dashboard** delivered real-time, personalized recommendations, while **statistical testing (t-tests, ANOVA)** confirmed significant differences in fuel efficiency. The project leveraged **Python, SQL, and Excel alongside tools like Streamlit, XGBoost, and scikit-learn**, and even explored experimental modeling with **TensorFlow and PyTorch**. By leveraging firsthand, **high-frequency data collected over ten weeks**, the **model avoided reliance on potentially outdated or generalized assumptions**. This ground-truth approach allowed for more accurate feature engineering, more nuanced training, and ultimately, a model that better reflects how people actually drive, spend, and decide in the real world.

## **Creative & Qualitative Writing**

### [Woodhaven: The Misunderstood Gem](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/MWS/blob/main/mohammedTiger.qualitativeAnalysis.ws.pdf)  
*"A compelling and well-organized analysis—felt like walking the streets while reading."*  

A **qualitative research project** capturing the **soul and complexity** of Woodhaven. Through **10 days of immersive fieldwork**, this study uncovers the **social, economic, and cultural layers** shaping this unique neighborhood.

### [Museum of Modern Art – A New Perspective](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/MWS/blob/main/mohammedTiger.MoMA.ws.pdf)  
*"A fresh and original perspective that redefines how we see modern art."*  

Commissioned for **Dr. TB**, a researcher at **NYU & the Smithsonian Institution**, this analysis explores **art’s evolving role in society**. Through an unconventional lens, it challenges traditional interpretations and sparks new conversations.
