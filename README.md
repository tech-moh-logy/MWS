- [Data Analysis using Python & SQL - Driver's Choice](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.dataAnalysis.highlanders.pdf): Longtime friends, Ahmed and Hossain, both Uber drivers, found themselves in the same car-buying boat. Their trusty steeds, worn thin by years of rideshare duty, were begging for retirement. The solution? A brand new 2024 Toyota Highlander XLE, a comfortable and spacious option for their passengers. But when it came to engine options, their paths diverged. Ahmed, ever the eco-conscious one, opted for the futuristic allure of the Highlander Hybrid, while Hossain stuck with the tried-and-true non-hybrid version. The price difference? A cool $5,900 (including tax). Now, both men are curious: would Ahmed's hefty investment in hybrid technology pay off in the long run? Only time, and miles driven, would tell.
