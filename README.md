Longtime friends, Ahmed and Hossain, both Uber drivers, found themselves in the same car-buying boat. Their trusty steeds, worn thin by years of rideshare duty, were begging for retirement. The solution? A brand new 2024 Toyota Highlander XLE, a comfortable and spacious option for their passengers. But when it came to engine options, their paths diverged. Ahmed, ever the eco-conscious one, opted for the futuristic allure of the Highlander Hybrid, while Hossain stuck with the tried-and-true non-hybrid version. The price difference? A cool $5,900 (including tax). Now, both men are curious: would Ahmed's hefty investment in hybrid technology pay off in the long run? Only time, and miles driven, would tell.

### Creative/Qualitative Writing
#### [Mohammed’s Qualitative Analysis: Woodhaven - The Misunderstood Gem](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/MWS/blob/main/mohammedTiger.qualitativeAnalysis.ws.pdf)
<b><i>"Wow! This analysis is incredibly well-organized and insightful. Your creative presentation style really brought the neighborhood to life. I felt like I was walking the streets while learning about the area's trends. This is fantastic!"</i></b>
<br>
For this qualitative research project, I've dedicated significant effort to exploring Woodhaven. Over the course of 10 days, I immersed myself in the area, navigating its streets on foot, and diligently seeking out parking spots. By car, the location is over an hour away from my home under optimal traffic conditions, while using public transportation, particularly the train, extends the commute to nearly two hours.
